# Card_Hand_Class
This is a Python class I wrote that simulates interactions one might have when playing a game of cards.
This project was done as part of a Data Structures in Python course at Montclair State University, as part of my MS in Data Science (completed Summer 2020).

Please find Card_Hand_Class.pdf file for full documentation.
The positional list code is provided by the textbook, "Data Structures and Algorithms in Python by Michael T. Goodrich Roberto Tamassia Michael H. Goldwasser."
